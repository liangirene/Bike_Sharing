# Bike_Sharing
In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate the demand for bike sharing services based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant features. By analyzing historical data, I aimed to provide insights into bike usage patterns and improve the efficiency of bike sharing systems.

## Data Preparation
Before diving into the analysis, I performed data preparation steps to ensure the data was in a suitable format for exploration and modeling. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. By preparing the data appropriately, I reading plaintext delimited data into `pandas` and ensured the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analyses.

## Exploring the Distribution of Riders
To gain a better understanding of the bike sharing data, I compared the distribution of daily counts between casual and registered riders. By visualizing these distributions, I identified any differences in the usage patterns and assess the contribution of each rider type to the overall demand. This analysis uncovered variations in behavior between these two groups.

## Visualization
Visualizations play a crucial role in data analysis, as they allow us to grasp patterns and relationships that might be challenging to capture through numbers alone. I leveraged various visualization techniques, including distribution plots, density plots, and bivariate kernel density plots, to explore the relationships between different variables such as temperature, humidity, and windspeed. These visualizations provided insights into the underlying trends and helped identify any outliers or unusual patterns in the data.

## Understanding Daily Patterns
To delve deeper into the behavior of riders, I plotted the average number of riders for each hour of the day over the entire dataset, stratified by rider type. This analysis allowed me to identify any distinct daily patterns in bike usage, such as peak hours or periods of low demand. By stratifying the data by rider type, I could also compare the usage patterns between casual and registered riders and identify any divergent behaviors.

## Analyzing the Impact of Weather
Weather conditions can significantly influence riders' behavior and the demand for bike sharing services. To assess the relationship between weather and ridership, I conducted an analysis to understand how different weather factors affect rider behavior. By examining variables such as temperature, precipitation, and windspeed in relation to the number of riders, I gained insights into how weather variations impact the demand for bike sharing services.
